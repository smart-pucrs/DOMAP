# DOMAP

The Distributed Online Multi-Agent Planning framework (DOMAP) provides multi-agent systems with capabilities to solve online multi-agent planning problems. It consists of three modular components: *goal allocation mechanism* - used to allocate goals to agents; *individual planner* -- used during each agent's individual planning stage; and *coordination mechanism* -- used before or after planning to avoid possible conflicts that can be generated while planning. DOMAP is implemented in the <a href="http://jacamo.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank"> JaCaMo </a> platform.
